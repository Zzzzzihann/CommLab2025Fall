     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FC Animalia earned a hard-fought 1–1 draw against Manchester City FC in a thrilling group stage encounter, 
     marked by early drama, stunning saves, and one very unconventional red card.
     </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City took the lead in the 12th minute, 
    when Erling Haaland capitalized on a defensive misstep and finished clinically past Buffhound. 
    Despite the early setback, Animalia remained composed and gradually regained control of possession.

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final moments of the first half, Lionel Meowssi delivered a moment of brilliance. 
        Awarded a free kick just outside the box, the feline forward curled a precise strike over the wall and into the top corner, 
        leaving City’s goalkeeper rooted to the spot. The stadium erupted — the equalizer restoring hope and rhythm to the home side.
      </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second half saw tension rise sharply. 
        In the 73rd minute, Kylian Mambappé received a red card following a controversial challenge in midfield. 
        Referees later clarified that “no venom was detected,” and play resumed after a brief pause.Despite being reduced to ten players,
        Buffhound produced a heroic performance between the posts, 
        making 15 saves — including three point-blank stops in the final minutes — to secure the draw.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result leaves FC Animalia sitting 14th in the group standings, 
        with one point from two matches.
        Next, 
        the team will travel to Allianz Arena to face Bayern Munich, 
    currently ranked 10th in the table. The match is expected to be a key test of Animalia’s defensive resilience and evolving team chemistry.
