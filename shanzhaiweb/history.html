    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded in London,
    FC Animalia is the world’s first animal-based football club — a team built on the belief that strength comes in many forms. 
    From the lightning-fast squirrel wingers to the powerful rhino defenders, our players prove that agility, intelligence, and collaboration matter just as much as size or strength.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At FC Animalia, we stand for equality across all species. We celebrate the unique abilities of every player, regardless of body type, gender, or background. 
    Our club operates on the principles of equal pay and equal play, promoting fairness both on and off the pitch.Our home, The Den Arena, welcomes 33,089 fans from land, sea, and sky. 
    The stadium includes 40 exclusive ocean-view seats for marine animals and 190 amphibian-friendly sections, ensuring that every supporter — no matter their habitat — can cheer in comfort.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are more than a football club; we are a movement. A movement that believes the game belongs to everyone — feathered, scaled, or furred.
    As our motto says, “Una Vox, Multae Bestiae” — One Voice, Many Beasts.
    We play as one, no matter how different our hearts beat.</p>
