    <h1>FC Animalia Regarding the Incident</h1>
    <h2>Involving Striker Kylian Mambappé</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="text-center">
    <p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FC Animalia confirms that during yesterday’s UEFA Champions League match between FC Animalia and Manchester City, 
     play was temporarily suspended following an unfortunate incident involving our striker Kylian Mambappé.
    </p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 73rd minute, during an attacking move, Mambappé unintentionally made physical contact with opposing defender John Stones. 
    Due to the referee’s position blocking the direct path forward, our player attempted to maneuver through a tight defensive line. 
    In the process, and in the heat of the moment, he inadvertently bit the opponent’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referee immediately issued a red card, and Mambappé was sent off. 
        We would like to clarify that no venom was involved and that the opposing player sustained no serious injury. 
        Medical staff confirmed that the bite was superficial and did not contain any toxic reaction.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mambappé has since expressed his deep regret to the opposing player, 
        to the match officials, and to fans watching both in the stadium and online. “It was an instinctive mistake,” Mambappé said. 
        “I didn’t intend to harm anyone — I was trying to keep balance while shielding the ball using my teeth. 
        I accept full responsibility and the referee’s decision.”
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FC Animalia has spoken with Mambappé, who will take part in a sportsmanship and self-control workshop organized by the Animal Football Federation (AFF). 
        The club reiterates its commitment to fair play, respect, and non-toxic competition, regardless of species.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate the understanding of our supporters and the football community as a whole.</p>
