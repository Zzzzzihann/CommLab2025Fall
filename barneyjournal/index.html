    <p onclick="goodby()">We are alone on the island now, Barney and I. It was something
of a jolt to have to sack Tayloe after all these years, but I had no alternative. The
petty vandalisms I could have forgiven, but when he tried to poison Barney out of
simple malice, he was standing in the way of scientific progress. That I cannot
condone.
I can only believe the attempt was made while under the influence of alcohol, it
was so clumsy. The poison container was overturned and a trail of powder led to
Barney's dish. Tayloe's defence was of the flimsiest. He denied it. Who else
then?</p>
