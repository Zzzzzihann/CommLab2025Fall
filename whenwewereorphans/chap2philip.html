        <p>• Born in 1857 in Birmingham, Philip began his career at Morgan Brook & Byatt Company in 1876 and later moved to Shanghai in the early 1880s. </p>
        <p>• He spoke fluent Mandarin and Shanghainese, and, as a colleague and close friend of the Banks family, he offered support to them following the disappearance of Mr. Banks.</p>
        <p>• On the day Mrs. Banks vanished, Uncle Philip took the young Christopher out to purchase a French accordion. After stepping down from the carriage at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiujiang Road, he briefly set Christopher aside, only to be swept away by the crowd and disappear from sight.</p>
