        <p>• Christopher Banks, born in Shanghai, lived in Shanghai International Settlement with his parents. He had a childhood friend named Akira.</p>
        <p>• He was sent to England at the age of nine following the disappearance of his parents and was placed under the guardianship of his aunt, Cecilia, in London.  </p>
        <p>• He later attended Cambridge University. Influenced by his parents’ unresolved case, he developed an early interest in criminal investigation and eventually became a well-known private detective after graduation.</p>
        <p>• Unmarried, he is the adoptive father of Jennifer, an orphan whose parents died in a maritime accident; she was briefly cared for by relatives in Canada before the adoption was completed.</p>
        <p>• Despite professional success, one unresolved matter remains in his personal record: the disappearance of his parents in Shanghai.</p>
        <p>• In recent years he has revisited surviving letters, newspaper clippings, and early testimonies, and now anticipates returning to Shanghai in hopes of reconstructing the remaining evidence.</p>
