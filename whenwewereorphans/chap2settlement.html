    <p>· After the Treaty of Nanking opened Shanghai to foreign trade, Britain and the United States each established concessions in the city, which were merged in 1863 to form the Shanghai International Settlement — an autonomous enclave for foreign residents administered by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
    <p>· Within the Settlement, a modern port-based financial system gradually developed, with foreign trading houses, banks, telegraph offices, customs, and dock facilities forming the infrastructure of capital, turning Shanghai into a crucial hub for the British imperial trade network, particularly in the circulation of goods from British India into China.</p>
    <p>· By the early 1900s, the Settlement had grown into a multilingual, multinational, and highly commercialized urban space — a prototype of a global city, where British and American expatriates lived alongside Japanese residents, Jewish refugees, and local Chinese communities, producing a semi-colonial society defined by interlaced legal and cultural systems.</p>
    <p>· Although the Settlement remained nominally Chinese territory, it operated under an independent administrative, policing, and judicial structure. Foreign nationals were exempt from Chinese law and instead fell under extraterritorial consular jurisdiction, effectively making the Settlement a “state within a state.”</p>
