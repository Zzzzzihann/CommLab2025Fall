From this work, I learned codes such as

```css
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="480px" src="Step4.jpg" alt="Step4:TapeIt">
     <pre style="display: inline-block;font-size:18px">
    𝙏𝙖𝙥𝙚 𝙞𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙞𝙣𝙫𝙞𝙨𝙞𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙘𝙚 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙣𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙨𝙞𝙜𝙝, 𝙗𝙤𝙭 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙥𝙖𝙥𝙚𝙧.
    𝙎𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙠, 𝙨𝙚𝙖𝙡, 𝙨𝙚𝙘𝙪𝙧𝙚—
    𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙩𝙖𝙥𝙚 𝙘𝙖𝙣𝙣𝙤𝙩 𝙗𝙞𝙣𝙙 𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙧𝙚𝙜𝙧𝙚𝙩𝙨.
    </pre>
```
which helps me a lot with the layouts.
